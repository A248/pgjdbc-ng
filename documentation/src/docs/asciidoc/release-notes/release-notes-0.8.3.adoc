[[release-notes-0.8.3-pgjdbc-ng-driver]]
=== PGJDBC-NG Driver

==== Bug Fixes

* Intervals are now parsed/formatted correctly according to server's or connection's `IntervalStyle`
* `PGNotificationListener.close` will only be called a single time
* Locale handling has been properly matched to the server and JVM respectfully
* Windows Locales are looked up in ROOT/ENGLISH locale
* Connection URL parameters are properly percent-escaped
* SQLData implementations handle nulls properly
* Version meta-data is now correct in shaded jar & fat-jar applications

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* `Interval` has been completely overhauled with a Java 9 `java.time` interface
* Due to fixes related to locale handling, text passed to the JDBC API must be in the JVM's locale and text being
  passed to the server must be in the server's locale; this shouldn't be an overly impactful.

==== New Features and Improvements

* PostgreSQL 12 is supported and part of the testing matrix
* CockroachDB is supported
* Batch executions use pipelined requests to increase performance by as much as 70%
* PostgreSQL COPY FROM/TO support
